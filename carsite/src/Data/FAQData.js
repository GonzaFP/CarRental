						cases, you’ll get approved immediately, and you’ll be
						set for every future road trip, business trip, and
						family vacation!`,

		question: "	Can other people drive a car that I booked?",

		answer: `	Yes, multiple guests can drive the car you book on
						CarRental, as long as they are all approved to drive.
						The primary driver (whoever booked the car) can add
						additional drivers with no fees or additional charges.
						Only the primary driver can request to add drivers; Our
						hosts cannot do it for you. We encourage you to request
						to add additional drivers before your trip starts,
						though guests can request to add a driver while a trip
						is in progress. To speed up the process, have your
						additional driver create an account and get approved to
						drive before you request to add them. All drivers must
						have a valid driver’s license and meet the age
						requirements for the car you’ve booked. You can request
						to add drivers via the “Trips” tab in the app without
						additional driver charges or extra costs.`,

		question: "	Can I get my car delivered to me?",

		answer: `Yes, many hosts offer delivery to travel hubs like

						near hundreds of airports, or you can have your car
						delivered for pickup and return at your hotel or
						vacation rental to save time and hassle. Some hosts
						offer free delivery, while others set their own delivery
						fee.`,
